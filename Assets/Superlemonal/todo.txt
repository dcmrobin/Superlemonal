    All through the game (at least, the first level) there are doors which can't be opened. Right now I have not got
    anything behind them, but I'll add a room behind each of them, as part of an easter egg that players discover
    when they get the achievement. ☆☆☆

    Portals that you can grab to make bigger and smaller, and portals that have a fixed size. Brackeys will help...
