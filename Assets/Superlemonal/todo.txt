Todo for superlemonal

    1.Add sound effect for when vending a can

3.Fix objects glitching into walls and other things when grabbed, possibly use Physics.OverlapBox for that

4.Add easter eggs, collectibles and the like (later)

5.Find out a way to play FMODStudioEventEmitter components from code

6.Add more details to the levels

7.Achievements

8.Add something like when you get an achievement, all the doors in the game could be permanently open.
    All through the game (at least, the first level) there are doors which can't be opened. Right now I have not got
    anything behind them, but I'll add a room behind each of them, as part of an easter egg that players discover
    when they get the achievement.

9.Make the objects you grab have fixed rotation, so that one side always faces you when you move it about

10.Portals
    Portals that you can grab to make bigger and smaller, and portals that have a fixed size. Brackeys will help...

11.Make the sound effects YOURSELF

12.Add signs that say things like "you shouldn't be here" around the place on the outside of the levels
